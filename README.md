
### Largest Files (Java)

by: Keith Fenske, https://kwfenske.github.io/

LargestFiles is a Java 1.4 console application to find the biggest files in a
list of file or folder names given on the command line. For example, if you
have an NTFS disk drive on Microsoft Windows and want to know if all files are
small enough to fit on a USB thumb drive (FAT32 format, maximum of 4 GB per
file).

There is no graphical interface (GUI) for this program; it must be run from a
command prompt, command shell, or terminal window. Run time will depend upon
how many files and folders are searched. Most operating systems protect some
folders, and this program treats those folders as empty. The code is a template
for simple applications that process files, folders, and subfolders.
